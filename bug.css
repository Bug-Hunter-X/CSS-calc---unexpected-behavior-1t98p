The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it might not work as expected if the units are inconsistent or there is an order of operations issue. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 50px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% - 20px + 100px);` might lead to unexpected results if the browser interprets the operations in an unexpected order.
